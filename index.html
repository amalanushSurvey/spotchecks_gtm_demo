    Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions
    already have. Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting
    information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the Wikimedia
    Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, with articles
    that often contain numerous links guiding readers to more information.
    Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers known as
    Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with Internet
    access, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent
    disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it has
    grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion
    visitors each month. Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-three million
    articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,893,198 articles in
    English, with 117,334 active contributors in the past month. Wikipedia's
    fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. While the
    Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines, new editors
    do not need to be familiar with them before they start contributing. Anyone
    can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. The quality of content is
    more important than who contributes it. The content must conform with
    Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable by published reliable
    sources. Contributions based on personal opinions, beliefs, personal
    experiences, unreviewed research, libellous material, and copyright
    violations are not allowed and will not remain. Wikipedia's software allows
    easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits.
    Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is
    continually created and updated, and encyclopedic articles on news events
    appear within minutes, making it more dynamic than most traditional
    resources. Anyone can improve Wikipedia, and more than 23 years of volunteer
    editors giving their time and talents to the project have made Wikipedia
    history's most comprehensive encyclopedia. Its editors add quality and
    quantity, remove misinformation, and fix errors and vandalism. The sources
    they provide are used by researchers worldwide (see Researching with
    Wikipedia). In summary, Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since
    2001 and has found that it succeeds. To start editing, simply click the Edit
    or Edit source buttons or the pencil icon at the top of any non-protected

    Category: Wikipedia basic information Wikipedia is a free online
    encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have. Wikipedia's
    purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of
    knowledge. Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia consists of freely
    editable content, with articles that often contain numerous links guiding
    readers to more information. Written collaboratively by largely anonymous
    volunteers known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone
    with Internet access, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to
    prevent disruption or vandalism. Since its creation on January 15, 2001, it
    has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a
    billion visitors each month. Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-three
    million articles in more than 300 languages, including 6,893,198 articles in
    English, with 117,334 active contributors in the past month. Wikipedia's
    fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. While the
    Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines, new editors
    do not need to be familiar with them before they start contributing. Anyone
    can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. The quality of content is
    more important than who contributes it. The content must conform with
    Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable by published reliable
    sources. Contributions based on personal opinions, beliefs, personal
    experiences, unreviewed research, libellous material, and copyright
    violations are not allowed and will not remain. Wikipedia's software allows
    easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits.
    Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. It is
    continually created and updated, and encyclopedic articles on news events
    appear within minutes, making it more dynamic than most traditional
    resources. Anyone can improve Wikipedia, and more than 23 years of volunteer
    editors giving their time and talents to the project have made Wikipedia
    history's most comprehensive encyclopedia. Its editors add quality and
    quantity, remove misinformation, and fix errors and vandalism. The sources
    they provide are used by researchers worldwide (see Researching with
    Wikipedia). In summary, Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since
    2001 and has found that it succeeds. To start editing, simply click the Edit
    or Edit source buttons or the pencil icon at the top of any non-protected
    page or section. vte Basic information on Wikipedia - (Search) Help
